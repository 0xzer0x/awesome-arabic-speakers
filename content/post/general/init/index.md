[Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic) is the third most widespread official language after English and French! It has **380 million** native speakers of all varieties (2024).

This repo goal is to create a curated and collaborative list of awesome Arabic speaker's contributions in tech regardless of their ethnicity, nationality, or location. Also, the contributions don't have to be in Arabic to be useful and add value.
